# MixTape-AI-Music-Generation-Platform

## About the Project 
AI Music Generation platform can become a reliable and cost-effective solution, for a business owner to produce their own music. Artificial Intelligence can be a life-saver, not only in terms of the number of financial resources a company would have to potentially spend on producing their unique music, but also in terms of the amount of time spent and the efforts made from the companyâ€™s side.

A web-based platform, which can be accessed across all the globe, would help the product gain customers without geographic limitations. AI algorithms can be trained to understand which combination of sounds make a pleasant-sounding tune (or music). This may be achieved using multiple Machine Learning Algorithms.
